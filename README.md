# Stanford-CS229-Machine-Learning
![](./simulator3.gif)
This is my problem set answer when I study Stanford CS229 Machine Learning, Fall 2018.

For each folder,
* `data` is the datasets given by the problem.
* `src` is the Python codes.
* `output` is the results of codes.
* `report` is the PDF file written by LaTeX.

What's more, there are Jupiter Notebook files which intuitively show the result of each problem.
